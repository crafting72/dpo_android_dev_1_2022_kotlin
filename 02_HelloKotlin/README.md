# Homework goals
To work:
- with print and println functions

# What needs to be done
Write a program that uses the print and println functions to output several suggestions about you to the console. The text may contain answers to questions: what is your name, where are you from, do you have any experience in IT - and any other information that you want to share.
1. Print the text to the console using the print and println functions. (The console does not always display the Russian language correctly. If you encounter this problem, try writing the text in English). Use several calls to the print/println function.
2. Leave a one-line or block comment on your code.
3. Comment out one or more lines of your code (To do this, you need to have several calls to the print/println functions in your code.
4. Run the program to check that it works.
