# Homework goals
- Learn how to create mutable and immutable variables of various types.
- Work with changing the values of variables.
- Track the dependence of variable values.
- Learn how to use string templates.

# What needs to be done
Write a program that works with the considered data types using mutable and immutable variables.
1. Create a firstName variable with the String type that references the string with your name.
2. Create a lastName variable with the String type that references the string with your last name.
3. Create a height variable with the Double type, which stores your height in meters and changes.
4. Create a weight variable with the Float type that stores your weight in kilograms.
5. Create an isChild variable with the Boolean type, which stores a value indicating that you are a child. The value of the variable should be calculated based on the values of the height and weight variables. Consider that a person is a child if the height is less than 150 cm or the weight is less than 40 kg.
6. Create an info variable that stores a string with information about you. The string should contain all the information available from the variables firstName, lastName, height, weight, isChild. Use string templates for this.
7. Output the value of the info variable to the console.
8. Change the value of the height variable after information is output from info.
9. Bring up the info information on the screen again, make sure that the updated value is displayed in the console.
10. Optional. Make sure that the information in the isChild variable is updated.
11. Optional. Make sure that the information on the screen is updated according to clause 9.
