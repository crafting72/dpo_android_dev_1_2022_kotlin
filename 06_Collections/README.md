# Homework goals
To practice working with collections.

# What needs to be done
The task consists of two parts. In the first, you will perform operations with lists, in the second, you will consider the basic principles of working with views.

Part 1
1. Enter the number N from the keyboard. The characters entered must be checked for compliance with the condition N > 0. If the condition is not met, the program must indicate an input error and prompt you to enter a number until the correct value is entered.
2. Create an immutable list of size N and fill it with random numbers from the range from -5 to 5 and output the resulting list to the console.
3. Convert the list to a modifiable one using the toMutableList() function and replace each even element in it with a number 10 times larger.
Example: the source list: [1,2,3,4], the resulting list: [1,20,3,40].
4. Calculate the sum of all the list items using the sumOf function and output the sum to the console.
5. Use the filter function to filter the list so that it contains only positive numbers, and output the resulting list to the console.

Part 2
Simulate the operation of the authorization page. First, fill in a conditional user database with usernames and passwords, and then try to log in several users. Such an imitation clearly shows the principles of working with representations.

During the implementation of the program, do not forget to display information messages â€” this will make it easier to track the progress of the program.
