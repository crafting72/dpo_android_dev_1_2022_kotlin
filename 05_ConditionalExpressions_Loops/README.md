# Homework goals
Learn how to write cycles and solve cyclic problems.

# What needs to be done
Develop a loop and write a program that calculates the nth number from the Fibonacci series.
1. The number n must be entered from the keyboard. The characters entered must be checked for compliance with the condition n > 0. If the condition is not met, the program must indicate an input error and prompt you to enter a number until the correct value is entered.
2. Calculate the desired term of the sequence using the formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) and the cycle.
3. Output the calculated value to the console. Make sure that the number is calculated correctly by checking it against the Fibonacci number table. Experiment with different n.
